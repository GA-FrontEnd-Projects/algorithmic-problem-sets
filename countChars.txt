Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns an object that counts the number of times each character occurs in the string.

countChars("I'm a cop, you idiot!") should return {"a" => 1, "c" => 1, "d" => 1, "i" => 3, "m" => 1, "o" => 3, "p" => 1, "t" => 1, "u" => 1, "y" => 1, "'' => 1, "!" => 1}

countChars("I'll be back") should return {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 1, "e" => 1, "k" => 1, "l" => 1, "i" => 1, "'' => 1}
