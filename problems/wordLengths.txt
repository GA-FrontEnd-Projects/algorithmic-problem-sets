Write a function that takes a sentence and returns an array containing the lengths of each word in the sentence. Do not include characters that are not letters, numbers, or dashes in the count.

wordLengths("It's my party and I'll cry if I want to") should return array(3,2,5,3,3,3,2,1,4,2)

wordLengths("Get to the chopper!") should return array(3,2,3,7)

function wordLengths(sentence) {
	var lengths = array();
	//do stuff
	return lengths;
}
